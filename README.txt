This is a small database containing a collection of data based upon a user's music library.

The SQL file holds both the data for creating tables, populating the tables with data, and sample queries to test data integrity.

INSTRUCTION

Run the CREATE DATABASE script first followed by the scripts to CREATE TABLEs and INSERT VALUES.
After run the queries one by one.

After running Line 230 you will have to DROP DATABASE and rebuild the database and tables.
